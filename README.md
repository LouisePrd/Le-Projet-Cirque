## ðŸŽª Chess Game
ChatPiteau, Sans Echecs, â€˜Cirque d'Hiverâ€™ ... Quite a lot of names for a project... Which doesn't have one yet.<br>

Welcome to the world that will soon be Anna Maria and Louise's if they keep clowning around for much longer.<br>
One knows the rules, the other doesn't : between circus, kawai and animals, let yourself be carried away for a wild game of chess with some unusual rules.<br>
